# XRSwitch
-- which stands for `xrandr` switcher. 

This is a very stupid, simple and naive tool to let me select the display profile for my box. 

## Usage
You just need a configurtion file in your XDG_CONFIG_HOME or in `.home/xrswitch`

There you'll list the profiles and the `xrandr` command needed to tune the screens. 

There is an `toml` configuration example provided in the code.
